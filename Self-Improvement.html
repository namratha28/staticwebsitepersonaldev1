I bet you could easily carve out a few hours in your day to learn a new skill. It’s all about shifting things around. Most notably, stop watching so much TV! Studies show that too much TV watching is harmful to our health.

How do you stop watching so much TV? For some, you will have to take drastic measures, like canceling your cable. For others, delaying the show works. Delaying is what works for.

Reading stimulates the mind. Do you know how many books I read last year? Zero. That falls in line with the numbers from 2012 that show 29% of Americans read 2 or less books. This year, I’ve read 4. Granted, 2 were while on my honeymoon. How do I find the time to read? Simple. I turn off the TV 30 minutes before bed and read. I don’t miss anything important on TV and it helps me to prepare for a good night’s sleep.

Along with learning new skills and reading, you should fill up you new found free time by meditating for 10 minutes per day. Some may think that meditating is a waste of time, but I find that clearing my head of all of my thoughts and just being present has a huge effect on my mood and happiness.

Along the same lines of accepting change is also learning to accept the past. What is done is done. Nothing you can do now will ever change the past. It’s part of history. The only thing you can do is learn from the experience and move on, push forward. Forgive and move forward. If you can’t learn to do that, you will never become the best person you can be. You will be focusing on the wrong things.

The old saying, “you are the company that you keep”, is true. If you are always hanging around with unmotivated people, you too will be unmotivated to succeed in life. On the other hand, if you hang around with successful people, you too will find success.



Are there people in your life you would be better off no longer spending time with?

Part of pushing through tough times is all about accepting change. Nothing in life is forever. Things are constantly changing – we age every day, the seasons change every 3 months. It’s part of life. The sooner you can accept that change happens, the sooner you can begin to be the best you possible

You will fail. You will struggle. Life will be hard sometimes. But you have to keep pushing through. This builds character. When you push through a hard time, the next hard time you encounter will be easier to get through. Why? Because you proved to yourself that you can get through anything. That belief is a huge part of self improvement.

When you lift heavy weights, your body exerts more effort and you release more hormones into your system. This is what makes you feel better and improves your mood.With this said, if you are brand new to lifting weights, definitely go light to start so that you don’t injure yourself".</i></p>

If you are going to work out, you might as well eat well too, right? I find when I am working out, I eat better. When I stop working out, I eat poorly. It’s a simple cycle really. I lift weights, I feel good about myself, I eat well and the cycle repeats.

Motivation Cycle

Most times you are feeling like crap because you are eating highly processed, sugary foods. Try to eat healthy just for a week. Limit your sugar intake and eat more natural foods – fruits and vegetables. The first day or so might be hard, but give your body time to adjust and you will be amazed.

Instead of taking the same way to work every day, try a new way. Make Tuesday nights family nights. Find simple ways to change things up in life.

While you change your habits, you should also focus on setting goals for yourself. Where do you want to be in one year, or three or five years? Don’t just write them down, but visualize these goals. Make the goals a part of you.

I have some long term goals for myself. I’ve gotten so good at visualizing them that I can see specific details, like blades of grass when I close my eyes and think of the house and yard I want to own. Don’t get upset if you can’t do this right away. Start small and just begin to visualize.

You are going to fail many times in life. Failing is OK. In fact, you should embrace failure. When you stretch beyond your comfort zone, you are growing as a person. It is only natural that you will fail. Don’t fall for the lie that failing is bad.

Think about failing like this: As a toddler, we have to learn to walk. If you ever watch a toddler learning to walk, she falls down many, many times. In other words, she fails countless times. Why is a child failing to learn to walk OK but you failing to learn a new skill as an adult a bad thing? At the end of the day it is still failure.It is only a bad thing if you never learn from it. Fail, learn and grow.
