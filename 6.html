<b>Digestive Breathing</b>

The first exercise to talk about is digestive breathing.  Start by sitting in a chair in an erect position. Then place both your hands on your knees with the fingers pointing downward such that your fingers find the 3 indentations on your knees.  Now using a slight pressure, stimulate the meridians on your knee. Slowly breathe in deeply and then exhale to contract and release your stomach muscles. Whenever you face any digestive problem, just do this exercise for 5 - 10 minutes to help promote digestion and get rid of any discomfort.
<br>
<b>Abdominal Lift</b>

Another great exercise for digestion is the abdominal lift. This abdominal lift has to be done early in the morning and before having breakfast. It is important that it is performed with an empty stomach. This abdominal lift gives a massage to your stomach region which will help prepare the organs responsible for digestion before the day starts.  Start by standing up straight with your feet shoulder width apart, keep your back straight and bend your knees slightly while you bend your chest forward and place your hands on the knees.  Exhale all the air from your lungs and place your chin on your chest.  Without inhaling, suck your stomach muscles in tightly and hold the position for a few seconds without inhaling.  Then slowly inhale, release your stomach muscles back to their neutral position and take a couple of deep breaths.  Continue the cycle of exhaling, sucking in your stomach muscles, and holding the position for a few seconds for about 10 times.

Walking After Meals

Another common and simple exercise which improves digestion is walking after meals. Studies have shown that regular walking helps maintain a good health in women and aging people. In a sedentary lifestyle, after having food we tend to become inactive and lounge around which is bad for our body. It is very useful to walk for 10 - 15 minutes after having any meal. Walking is the easiest form of exercise. So anyone who is not doing any exercise should at least walk daily for good and sound health.

<b>Yoga</b>
<br>
Yoga is found to be extremely beneficial in aiding the digestion process. Simple yoga exercises like Vajrasana and Yoga Mudra can immensely help in the digestion process.

Vajrasana is a posture in which one has to sit in an erect position with the knees folded and your feet flat against the floor. While sitting in this position, your feet can be touching the sides of your hips or positioned underneath your buttocks. Rest the palms of your hands on the knees or upper thighs. Sitting daily in this position while breathing slow, steady breathes for 10 - 15 minutes will help your body and relieve stress.

Yoga Mudra is found to be extremely beneficial for the stomach muscles and also prevents diabetes. You can sit in a Vajrasana posture, but put your feet flat on the floor positioned and sit gently on top of them instead of keep your feet on the side of your hips. Now clasp your arms behind your back and slowly lower your head to touch the ground and remain in this position for some time. Then, you can go back to your original position and repeat this for about four to five times. Studies have proven that the Yoga Mudra increases parasympathetic activity and lowers blood pressure.
