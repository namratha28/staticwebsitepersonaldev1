<b>Simple exercises</b>
<br><b>Leg stretch</b> Sit on the floor with your legs stretched out in front.  Keeping your foot to the floor, slowly bend one knee until you feel it being comfortably stretched.  Hold for 5 seconds. Straighten your leg as far as you can and hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times with each leg.
<br><b>Leg cross</b> Sit on the edge of a table or bed. Cross your ankles over. Push your front leg backwards and back leg forwards against each other until the thigh muscles become tense. Hold for 10 seconds, then relax. Switch legs and repeat. Do 4 sets with each leg.
<br><b>Sit/stands</b> Sit on a chair. Without using your hands for support, stand up and then sit back down. Make sure each movement is slow and controlled. Repeat for 1 minute. As you improve, try to increase the number of sit/stands you can do in 1 minute and try the exercise from lower chairs or the bottom two steps of a staircase.
<br><b>Step ups</b> Step onto the bottom step of stairs with the right foot. Bring up the left foot, then step down with the right foot, followed by the left foot. Repeat with each leg until you get short of breath. Hold on to the bannister if necessary. As you improve, try to increase the number of steps you can do in 1 minute and the height of the step.
<br><b>Knee squats</b>Hold onto a chair or work surface for support. Squat down until your kneecap covers your big toe. Return to standing. Repeat at least 10 times. As you improve, try to squat a little further. Don’t bend your knees beyond a right angle.
