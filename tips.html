    <b>Set Limits On Your Time</b>
 Just because you have a home office or your work number is a cell phone, that doesn’t mean that you have to be available 24/7, or that you’re obligated to work long into the night. Just like a normal job, give yourself and your clients a schedule, and stick with it. If you’re going to call it a day at 6pm, then shut down your email and turn off your phone at six and don’t turn them on again until the morning. Also, consider getting a separate cell phone for work so that clients aren’t constantly bombarding your personal number.

<b>    Manage Your Money Wisely</b>
 When all the money is coming to you instead of just a paycheck from a normal job, it can sometimes be tempting to overspend. The problem arises when you’re not putting away enough to survive if you have a few less-than-stellar sales months, or even worse – if you’re not accounting for the fact that you have to handle your own taxes and other business related expenses. Make sure you’re managing your finances realistically, and don’t be afraid to talk to an accountant if you need help. The price of getting help will be much less than the price of making a mistake on your own.

        <b>Know What You Want</b>
 Hard work and skills are all well and good, but without an overarching direction for your business, you’ll never be able to realize your full potential. Make sure that you know where you want to end up, and examine every step you take to make sure it lines up with your end goal. If it doesn’t, that may be a sign that you need to reevaluate that step and head in a different direction.

 <b>   Be Yourself</b>
 When you’re a small business, it can sometimes be tempting to act a bit bigger than you really are, or to attempt to come across as corporate when you’re really just a one-person show. While this may be a tactic that works for some, just being yourself is much easier, and probably isn’t going to cost you any business. The whole point of being self-employed is that you’re selling yourself and <br>
your skills, so it’s safe to say that your personality is part of the package.

  <div class="slide w3-large">
  <b> Never Stop Learning</b>
 I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again – if you’re not constantly learning and improving, you’re not going to remain valuable or relevant as technologies change and update. The field of SEO is a great example. Google is constantly updating how their search engine ranks sites, and things that worked even a few years ago would be useless today, or may even have a negative effect. If you tried to sell the same services that you were selling five years ago to someone today, they’d laugh and hang up the phone. You have to continually be learning and adjusting to give yourself the best advantage in whatever field of work you’re in.

    <p><b>Trade Related Entrepreneurship Assistance and Development Scheme for Women (TREAD)</b>

This scheme focuses on women entrepreneurs who are involved in non-agricultural activity. The Central government provides a grant up to 30 percent of the project cost to Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) that promote women entrepreneurship. The remaining 70 percent is arranged by the lending agency in terms of credit.

 

Additionally, the government also provides a grant up to INR1 lakh for each programme envisaged by training institutes or NGOs for providing training to women. There is also a government-sponsored need-based grant program that provides up to INR5 lakh to nationally-recognized Entrepreneurship Development Institutes (EDIs) that undertake research and evaluation studies and participate in courseware design.</p>

    <p><b>Mahila Coir Yojana</b>

This women-focused scheme for the coir industry seeks to provide self-employment to the rural female population in areas with established coir production clusters. 

 

Under the scheme, motorized spinning machines (ratts) are provided at a discount to women engaged in the production of coir. A two-month training program is initially provided at the Coir Board’s Training Centres. One women artisan per household is eligible for assistance under the scheme.

 

The monthly stipend for trainees has been raised to INR750 from the earlier INR500. The Coir Board provides ratts at a subsidized price of 25 percent with a higher limit of INR7,500 for motorized ones and INR3,200 for the traditional variety. The balance cost has to be met by the beneficiary.

 

Apart from these marquee schemes, the Ministry of MSME also provides assistance through other nodes such as the National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC). Need-based funding and credit schemes, with a special focus on women entrepreneurs, are available.</p>
